ABOUT:
Hyrule Kings is a full conversion modification for Crusader Kings II, based on Hyrule Conquest, Hyrule Total War, The Legend of Zelda RPG duology and the Legend of Zelda franchise. 

FAQ:
1. Is this based on canon? Will you have bookmarks for x game?

Hyrule Kings is based on Hyrule conquest, and as such deviated from canon to form its own more cohesive world. However, characters, places and events from games are represented in many places.

2. Is this the same Hyrule Kings mod from 2015?

Hyrule Kings is not affiliated with the cancelled project still on Moddb. We have chosen to use the name as the original project has not only been completely abandoned, but never even passed the conceptual stage.

3. Can you put my original characters in the mod?

If you catch us in a good mood and ask nicely, we might consider adding in a count or barony-level character of your choosing. Priority goes to contributors who help with the mod by making art, helping with coding, troubleshooting or offering other types of assistance.

4. I want to help you with the mod, where can I reach you?
